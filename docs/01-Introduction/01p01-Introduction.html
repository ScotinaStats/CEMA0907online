# A Case Study

---

# Sarah the chimp

.pull-left[
- In 1978, researchers Premack and Woodruff published a study in *Science* magazine, reporting an experiment where an adult chimpanzee named Sarah was shown videotapes of eight different scenarios of a human being faced with a problem.

- After each videotape showing, she was presented with two photographs, one of which depicted a possible solution to the problem.

- Sarah could pick the photograph with the correct solution for seven of the eight problems!

# How?!

What are **two possible explanations** for Sarah getting 7 correct answers out of 8?

--

1. Sarah was just guessing and got lucky. 

2. Sarah can do better than just guessing. 

--

**Which explanation do you think is better?**

--

- I think explanation (1) is better. How can you convince me that (1) is *not* the better explanation?

---

# Refuting Explanation (1)

Let's try to look at what Sarah's results would be, **if she just guessed**. 

- What is a simple way to *model* guessing between two choices?

--
.center[
&lt;img src="coin_flip.png" width="25%" /&gt;
]
--

Let's define "heads" as a *correct answer* and "tails" as an *incorrect answer*. 

- If Sarah were just guessing ("flipping a coin"), what would be the **expected** number of correct guesses ("heads")?

---

# Simulating Guessing

If Sarah were just guessing, we would *expect* the number of correct guesses to be 4. 

- However, not every set of 8 coin tosses will result in 4 heads. 

- Let's repeat the set of 8 coin tosses many times, to generate the pattern for correct answers that could happen in the long run, **under the assumption that Sarah is just guessing**.

# What do you notice?

The **distribution** of the rate of correct answers, **under the assumption that Sarah was guessing**, is centered at 0.50 (50%, or 4 correct answers out of 8). 

- The red line indicates the **observed proportion** of correct answers, 7 out of 8 (87.5%). 

The majority of the distribution lies between 0.25 and 0.75. 

- This means that, if Sarah were actually guessing, then it would be *highly unlikely* to observe 7 out of 8 correct answers. 

- Thus, we are fairly convinced that Sarah is doing better than just guessing. 

--

**What if Sarah got 5 correct answers out of 8 instead?** Would we still be convinced of Sarah's ability to do better than guessing?

# SPOILER ALERT!!!

We just conducted a **statistical hypothesis test**, and this will be the last topic covered in Statistics in the Real World. 

Let's start from the beginning...

# Where are you?

Statistics in the Real World!

**Some information**

- Our textbook:
    - **ModernDive**: Statistical Inference via Data Science
    - Webpage: [https://moderndive.com](https://moderndive.com)
    - Completing the assigned readings is **crucial**!!!
    
- See the **Syllabus** on Canvas for more information!

# Introduction

---

# Course Objectives

- Learn how to answer scientific questions with **data**. 

.center[
&lt;img src="ds_pipeline.png" width="2045" /&gt;
]

- Statistics isn't just a bunch of numbers and math. We will aim to cover the entire **data science pipeline** in this course. 

---

# Course Objectives

In order to foster a conceptual understanding of statistics, use **real data** whenever possible.

**How can we do this?**

- Two engines:
    1. Mathematics: formulas, approximations, probability theory, etc.
    2. Computing: simulations, random number generating, etc.
  

- In *this* class:
    - Less of (1)
    - More of (2)

# Introduction to R

---

# Using R Studio

After **downloading R/RStudio** or opening **RStudio Cloud**:

1. Open **R Studio** (never open **R**). 

2. In the menu bar at the top of your screen: **File** -- **New File** -- **New Script**

.center[
&lt;img src="r-window.png" width="75%" /&gt;
]

---

# The R Studio Window

.center[
&lt;img src="r-window.png" width="50%" /&gt;
]

**The Four Panels**:

1. **Console** (bottom-left): This is where you can perform simple calculations or run/execute commands. 
    - Either type code directly into the console, or run from a the *editor*...
2. **Editor** (top-left): This is where you can save and edit *R code* and *text* into a **script** or **R Markdown files**.
    - Save all of your code in a script (.R) or R Markdown (.Rmd) files!!!
3. **Files, Packages, Help, Plots** (bottom-right): See your files, packages, help screens, and plots (more in a few...).
4. **Environment** (top-right): Your current workspace (more in a few...).

# Basic Programming Concepts

**Vectors**: a series of values, created using the `c()` command. 
- Type
    
    ```r
    c(8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9)
    ```

    into the **console** (bottom-left) and press "Enter".
- Type 
    
    ```r
    c(8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9)
    ```

    into your **script** (top-left) and click "Run" *while your cursor is on the same line*.
    
Think of `c()` as standing for "*concatenate*" or "*combine*".
    
---

# Basic Programming Concepts

- Type 
    
    ```r
    c("Somebody", "once", "told", "me", "the", "world", "is", "gonna", "roll", "me")
    ```

    into your **script** and click "Run".
- Type 
    
    ```r
    c(Somebody, once, told, me, the, world, is, gonna, roll, me)
    ```

    into your **script** and click "Run". What happened?
    
--

Make sure any **character** variable (e.g., non-numerical) is surrounded by *quotation marks*! 

--

**Pro-tip**: Press [command] + [return] (Mac) while your cursor is on the same line as your code, and the line will run!

---

# Basic Programming Concepts

**Assignment**: Let's *assign* the vector `c(8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9)` to a variable, so we don't have to keep typing it out. 
- Type 
    
    ```r
    jenny = c(8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9)
    ```

    and click "Run".
    
    - **Note**: The symbol `&lt;-` also works in place of `=`, so you can use *either* for assignment. 

--

- You might think nothing happened after that last example. But look to the **Environment** panel (top-right). 
    - Now, type 
        
        ```r
        mean(jenny)
        ```
    
        and click "Run".

# Arithmetic

At its core, R Studio can act as a simple calculator:
- `+` : addition
- `-` : subtraction
- `*` (shift + 8) : multiplication
- `/` : division
- `^` (shift + 6) : exponent

--

Run the following equations:
- `2+2`
- `753-342`
- `359*315`
- `118/21`
- `5^3`
- `8/2*(2+2)`
- `8/(2*(2+2))`
