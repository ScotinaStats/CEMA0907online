# R Packages

We will be using **R packages** extensively.
- R is *open-source*, which means that members in the community can provide additional functions, data, or documentation in a *package*. 
- Packages are *free* and can be easily downloaded. 

--

**Downloading packages in R Studio**

> **Packages** tab (bottom-right) -- **Install** -- Type package name and press *Install*

- Install the following packages (separate by a comma when typing the names):
    - `tidyverse`: suite of packages that we will use *extensively*
    - `moderndive`: package that accompanies the textbook
    - `infer`: package for statistical inference
    - `openintro`, `babynames`, `nycflights13`: packages with useful datasets
    
---

# Loading R Packages

We load R packages with the `library()` function. 
- Note that, while you only **install** packages once, you must **load** them *each time you open a new R session*. 

Run the following:
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Now this suite of packages (and their **dependencies**) is loaded!
    
---

# Functions

Once we define **objects**, **variables**, and/or **datasets**, much of data analysis involves applying a series of **functions** to the data. 

We have already used several functions!
- `c()`
- `mean()`
- `install.packages()` 

--

R functions typically require one or more *arguments*. 
- Some arguments are *pre-set* to **default values**. 

Run the following:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
?mean
?sum
?sqrt
```

---

# Data Frames

**Data frames**:  analogous to rectangular spreadsheets you would see in Excel or Google Spreadsheets. 

- Rows of a data frame correspond to *observations*, and columns correspond to *variables*. 

--

The `mpg` data frame (contained in the `ggplot2` package, which is part of `tidyverse`), contains fuel economy data for 38 popular car models from [http://fueleconomy.gov](http://fueleconomy.gov). 

Run the following two lines:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # Run only if you haven't loaded this yet
mpg
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(mpg)
```

---

# `mpg` Data Frame

A few notes on this dataset...

- A "tibble" is a type of data frame in R. The `mpg` data frame has:
    - 234 **rows**
    - 11 **columns**
    
- The 11 columns correspond to 11 different **variables**. Some of which are: *manufacturer*, *model*, *cty*, *hwy*, etc.

- In the console, we are shown the first 10 rows by default, since the rest can't fit on the screen. 

---

# Exploring Data

The `$` operator allows us to explore a single variable within a data frame. For example, run the following in your console:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
mpg
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mpg$manufacturer
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mpg$cty
```

- The `$` extracts only the `manufacturer` or `cty` variable from the `mpg` data frame and returns it as a **vector**. 

---

# Exploring Data

We can use the `$` operator to calculate descriptive statistics for variables within a dataset:

```{r, comment = ""}
mean(mpg$cty)
```

**What do you think `cty` means?**

--

You can get help in R by entering a `?` before the name of a function or data frame (*if it comes in an R package*), and a page will appear in the bottom-right panel. 

- Try the following:
```{r}
?mpg
```

I use the help files **all the time**, and you should too, especially if you're stuck with a specific function!

---

# Types of Variables

The object `mpg$city` is not one object, but *several*, contained within a **vector**. 

The `class()` function gives the `class` of an object (e.g., *variable types*). 
```{r}
class(mpg$cty)
```

```{r}
class(mpg$class)
```

---

# Coercion

Elements of a vector must all be of the *same type*. If we try to combine *numbers* and *characters*, strange things can happen:
```{r}
giant_glass = c(1, 800, 54, "giant")
giant_glass
class(giant_glass)
```

--

R **coerced** the data into *characters*! 
- It thinks that, because you put a *character string* in the vector, you mean for the numbers in the vector to be characters as well. 

--

Why doesn't this give a numeric answer?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mean(giant_glass)
```

---

# Logical Vectors

Another important type of vector is a **logical** vector. These must be either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. 

Is 3 equal to 2?!
```{r}
test = (3 == 2)
test
```

Note that while `=` (and `<-`) are used for **assignment**, a double `==` is used to *test for equality*. 

--

**Example**

Before you run this, try to guess what the result will be!
```{r, eval = FALSE}
test_vec = c(3 == 2, 3 == 3, 3 < 4, 3 < 2)
test_vec
```

---

# Other Functions

`seq()` generates a *sequence* of numbers 

```{r}
# Vector:
x = c(1,2,3)

# We can also define a vector that is a sequence of numbers
y = seq(1, 10, by = 2)
y

# Combine x and y into one vector
c(x, y)
```

When `by = 1`, we can use a shortcut...

```{r}
1:10
```

---

# Indexing

In order to retrieve a *specific element* of a vector or data frame, we can use square brackets `[ ]`:
```{r}
# Retrieve the 5th element of mpg$hwy
mpg$hwy[5]

# Retrieve the 5th THROUGH 10th elements of mpg$hwy
mpg$hwy[5:10]
```

--

We can get pretty creative with indexing...

```{r}
# Retrieve only mpg$hwy ABOVE 35
mpg$hwy[mpg$hwy > 35]
```

--

**Note** (to Python users): In R indexing begins at `1`, *not* `0`. 

---

# Indexing

Of course, the previous exercise is pretty meaningless since we don't know *which cars* have good fuel economy. 
- We can index a data frame by specifying both the *row number(s)* and *column number(s)*. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Access the 5th ROW across ALL columns
mpg[5, ]
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Access the 5th ROW of the columns named "manufacturer" and "hwy"
mpg[5, c("manufacturer", "hwy")] 
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Check which cars get more than 35 highway miles per gallon
mpg[mpg$hwy > 35, ]
```

# R Markdown

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("rmarkdown_hex.png")
```

# R Markdown

**R Markdown** provides a way for R (and python/SQL) users to produce a single file containing code, output, and notes. 

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("rmarkdown.png")
```
]

Time for a **demo**! 

Click **File** -- **New File** -- **R Notebook**

---

# R Markdown Activity

Work on the following:

- Create a new folder called `CEMA0928_Notes`. 

- Save the R Markdown file you just opened to this folder as `01-Introduction_Notes`. You can either use **Save As...** from the File menu, or click on the blue disc icon in the top-left panel. 

- What do you think are the differences between the *white* blocks of text and the *gray* blocks of text?

- What happens when you click the **Knit** icon at the top of the R Markdown file?

- Create a "code chunk" similar to the one with `plot(cars)` on lines 10-12, but type `summary(cars)`. 
    - **Pro-tip**: Press [command]+[option]+[I] (Mac), or [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[I] (Windows) to create a blank code chunk!
    
---

# Chunk Options

- `echo = FALSE`: Don't *show* code

- `eval = FALSE`: Don't *evaluate* the code

- `include = FALSE`: Don't show the code or the results

- `message = FALSE`: Don't show the messages
    - This is usually relevant when you load a package but want to suppress the different "welcome" messages they might give. 
    
- `warning = FALSE`: Don't show warning messages

- `out.width = "50%"` Makes a figure half the size (you can change the percentage to fit your needs). 

In general, show your code and your results, but not your messages.

---

# What's to come?

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("moderndive-flow.png")
```
