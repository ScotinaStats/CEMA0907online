# `mutate()` existing variables

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("dplyr_mutate.png")
```
]

- Using `mutate()`, we can take existing variables and *transform* them into new variables. 

---

# `mutate()`

In the `weather` data frame, the variable `temp` is temperature in **degrees Fahrenheit**. To convert this to **degrees Celcius**, we use the formula:

$$\text{temp in C}=\frac{\text{temp in F}-32}{1.8}$$

--

Using `mutate`, we can create the variable `temp.C` using the existing `temp`:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
weather = weather %>%
  mutate(temp.C = (temp - 32)/1.8)
View(weather)
```

---

# `mutate()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
weather = weather %>%
  mutate(temp.C = (temp - 32)/1.8)
View(weather)
```

Note that we call this new data frame `weather`, which *overwrites* the existing one that comes with the `nycflights13` package. 

- **Why?** We are not *losing* any information; only *adding* new information!
- The original `temp` variable is still part of the data frame. 

---

# `mutate()`

We can use the results of `mutate()` with other functions we already covered, such as `group_by()` and `summarize()`:

```{r, include = FALSE}
weather = weather %>%
  mutate(temp.C = (temp - 32)/1.8)
```
```{r, eval = FALSE, comment = ""}
summary.temp.monthly = weather %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(mean.temp.F = mean(temp, na.rm = T), 
            mean.temp.C = mean(temp.C, na.rm = T))
View(summary.temp.monthly)
```

---

# `mutate()` 

Suppose we wanted to recover each state's **total GDP**. 

```{r}
head(gapminder, 5)
```

The `gapminder` dataset has the `pop` and `gdpPercap` variables already, so we can *create* a new `gdp` variable by multiplying them together. 

---

# `mutate()`

Using `mutate()`, we can create a new variable called `gdp` by multiplying `pop` and `gdpPercap`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gapminder_new = gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdp = pop*gdpPercap)
View(gapminder_new)
```

--

We could use `mutate()` along with `filter()` and `select()` to see how the total GDP has changed in the United States over the years:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "United States") %>%
  mutate(gdp = pop*gdpPercap) %>%
  select(country, year, gdp)
```

# Practice

Refer to the `dimaonds` data frame. 

- The variable `carat` refers to the weight of the diamond, where **1 carat = 200 milligrams**. 
- Create a new variable, `mg`, by using this formula: 
$$\text{mg}=\text{carat}*200$$

--

*Solution*

```{r, eval = FALSE}
diamonds = diamonds %>%
  mutate(mg = carat*200)
View(diamonds)
```
