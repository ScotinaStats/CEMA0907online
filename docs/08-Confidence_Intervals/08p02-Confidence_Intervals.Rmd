# The `infer` Package for Statistical Inference

---

# `infer`

The `infer` package provides a useful resource in building **confidence intervals** and conducting **hypothesis tests** (more on those later). 

There are several *verb-named functions* that build in order...

---

# Step 1: `specify()`

The `specify()` function is used primarily to choose which variables will be the focus of the statistical inference.
- This is done using the `response = ` argument:

```{r, comment = ""}
pennies_sample %>%
  specify(response = year)
```

---

# Step 2: `generate()` replicates

After `specify()`-ing the main variable of interest, we use `generate()` to generate **bootstrap samples** (i.e., *replicates*) from the original sample. 
- Here, we can easily create 1,000 bootstrap samples:
```{r}
thousand_bootstrap_samples = pennies_sample %>%
  specify(response = year) %>%
  generate(reps = 1000)
```

If you use `View(thousand_bootstrap_samples)`, you will see that there are 40,000 rows! 
- We took 1,000 bootstrap samples, each of size 40. 

---

# Step 3: `calculate()` summary statistics

Once we have 1,000 **bootstrap samples**, we need to calculate a **summary statistic** for each sample. 
- In this example, the *summary statistic* is the **mean**. 
```{r, message = FALSE}
bootstrap_distribution = pennies_sample %>% 
  specify(response = year) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")
```

--

This generates a data frame with 1,000 rows: each row containing the sample mean of the respective **bootstrap sample**. 
- This set of 1,000 sample means represents a **bootstrap distribution**. 

---

# Step 4: `visualize()` the results

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("infer.png")
```
]

---

# Step 4: `visualize()` the results

```{r, out.width = "50%", warning = FALSE}
x_bar = pennies_sample %>%
  summarize(stat = mean(year))
bootstrap_distribution %>%
  visualize(obs_stat = x_bar)
```

# Confidence Intervals

# Confidence Intervals

A **confidence interval** gives a range of *plausible values* for a population parameter. 
- Using *only* a **sample statistic** to estimate a parameter is like fishing in a murky lake with a spear, and using a confidence interval is like fishing with a net.

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fishing.png")
```
]

---

# Confidence Intervals

Confidence intervals depend on a specified **confidence level**, with *higher* confidence levels corresponding to *wider* confidence intervals and *lower* confidence levels corresponding to *narrower* confidence intervals. 
- Common **confidence levels** include 90%, 95%, and 99%.

--

Using the **bootstrap distribution** (i.e., `bootstrap_distribution` from earlier), there are two ways we can obtain a confidence interval for the population mean year on US pennies:
1. The **percentile method**
2. The **standard error method**
