# One Categorical Explanatory Variable

---

# Motivating Example

Do you think that **waterfront homes** are typically *more expensive* than **non-waterfront homes**?

--

.pull-left[
**Waterfront Home**
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("waterfront_seattle.jpg")
```
]

.pull-right[
**Non-waterfront Home**
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("nonwaterfront.jpg")
```
]

# Practice

Using `house_prices`, perform *all steps from the regression analysis* of **bedrooms** (*x*) and **price** (*y*), but use `waterfront` as the *x* variable *instead*. 

- What do you notice about how `lm()` reports information for a **categorical explanatory variable**?

---

# Summary Statistics

```{r}
house_prices %>%
  select(price, waterfront) %>%
  group_by(waterfront) %>% #<<
  summarize(mean_price = mean(price), sd_price = sd(price))
```

---

# Data Visualization

```{r, out.width = "45%"}
ggplot(data = house_prices, aes(x = waterfront, y = price)) + 
  geom_jitter() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
  labs(x = "Waterfront home?", y = "Price (in $)") 
```

---

# A (Better) Data Visualization

Because the *x* variable is **categorical**, a *boxplot* might be a better visualization. 
```{r, out.width = "45%"}
ggplot(data = house_prices, aes(x = waterfront, y = price)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + #<<
  labs(x = "Waterfront home?", y = "Price (in $)") 
```

---

# Linear Regression Model

```{r}
lm_waterfront = lm(price ~ waterfront, data = house_prices)
get_regression_table(lm_waterfront)
```

$$\widehat{price}=531564+1130312\cdot waterfrontTRUE$$

--

Okay... what does `waterfrontTRUE` mean?!

---

# Dummy Variables

$$\widehat{price}=531564+1130312\cdot waterfrontTRUE$$

When using a **categorical explanatory variable** in a regression model, the *estimated coefficient* corresponds to the **difference in means** between:

- one level of the categorical explanatory variable, and
- the *reference level* of the categorical explanatory variable (usualy the level that comes first *alphabetically*)

--

Because the `waterfront` variable takes *two levels* (`TRUE` and `FALSE`), the *reference level* is `FALSE`. 

- $b_{1}=1130312$: Homes with a *waterfront view* are *predicted* to cost, **on average**, <span>&#36;</span>1,130,312 more than *non-waterfront homes*. 

- $b_{0}=531564$: Homes *without a waterfront view* (i.e., `waterfrontTRUE = 0`) are *predicted* to cost, **on average**, <span>&#36;</span>531,564. 
---

# Practice

Using the `gapminder2007` data (filtering code below), conduct a *linear regression analysis* of `lifeExp` (*y*) against `continent` (*x*). 

- What does this tell you about the relationship between life expectancy and continent?

- What do the different regression coefficients mean in this context?

```{r}
gapminder2007 = gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007 & continent != "Oceania") %>% 
  select(country, continent, lifeExp, gdpPercap)
gapminder2007$continent = factor(gapminder2007$continent)
```

```{r}

**We knew the regression coefficients the whole time!!!**
